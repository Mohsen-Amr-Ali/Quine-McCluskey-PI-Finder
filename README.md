# Quine–McCluskey Prime Implicant Finder  
**Digital Logic Circuits I – Bonus Project**  
*Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University*

This repository contains my individual submission for the **Digital Logic Circuits I** bonus project. The program implements the **Tabular Method** (Quine–McCluskey algorithm) for finding **prime implicants** of Boolean functions with an arbitrary number of variables.
